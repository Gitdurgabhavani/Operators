1.What are the conditional operators in java?
Ans.In Java, conditional operators check the condition and decides the  result on the basis of both conditions.

2.What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans.There are two types of mathematical operators: unary and binary.
 Unary operators perform an action with a single operand. Binary operators perform actions with two operands.

3.What is the use of Switch case in Java Programming?
Ans.The switch case in java is used to select one of many code blocks for execution.

4.What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Ans.Multiplication and division are supposed to take place before addition and subtraction (unless parentheses are used to change the order of operation).

5. What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans.Conditional statements define conditions that are true or false and then execute based on whether or not the condition is true.
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

6. What is the syntax of if-else statement?
Ans. The syntax of if-else statement is:
      if(condition){
          statement - 1
      }   else {
          statement - 2
      }      

7.What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
Ans.For loop
    While loop
    Do- While loop

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
Ans.Both for loop and while loop is used to execute the statements repeatedly while the program runs.
 The major difference between for loop and the while loop is that for loop is used when the number of iterations is known,
 whereas execution is done in the while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong.

9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
Ans.public class WhileExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int i=1;
while(i<=10){
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}
}
}
